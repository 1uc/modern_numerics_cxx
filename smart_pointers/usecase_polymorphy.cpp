// Smart pointers are very useful and frequently used when dealing with
// polymorphic objects.
//
// Please look at `polymorphism/usecase_odes.cpp` since it shows you how to:
//   1. Use composition to build generic code.
//   2. Use smart pointers to effortlessly control the lifetime of (polymorphic)
//      objects.
