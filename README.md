# Modern Numerics oriented C++
This is a very incomplete and drafty collection of topics in C++ that are
useful in the context of numerical simulations. It should generalize to other
areas since it's rarely highly numerics specific.

NOTE: The state is of the collection is that of a draft! It's certainly full of
typos and likely contains some more serious errors too.
